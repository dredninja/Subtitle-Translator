Now, my young opponent here

00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,186
wants to gut
the Gotham Renewal Program,

secret friend. Whoo?

Haven't a clue?

185

Let's play a game,
just me and you.

186
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,788
What does a liar do
when he's dead?"

187
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,208
There's a cipher too.

188

Any of this

00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,596
What's going on here?

190
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,975
I asked him to come, Pete.

191
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,852
[Pete] This is a crime scene.

192
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,188
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

193
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,148
I got the press downstairs.

194
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,067
You know, I cut you
a lot of slack, Jim,

195
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,109
'cause we got history.

196
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,070
But this is way over the line.

197
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
Wait.

198
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,618
-He's involved in this?
-No, he's not involved.

199
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,994
How do you know?

200
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,830
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,417
[Gordon] I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

203
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,086
He lies still.

204
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,588
Excuse me?

205
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,549
The riddle.

206
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,927
What does a liar do
when he's dead?

207
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,220
He lies still.

208
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, Jesus.

209
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,861
This must be your favorite
night of the year, huh, pal?

Happy fuckin' Halloween.

211

[Martinez] Excuse me,
Commissioner.

They're ready
for your statement.

213

I want him outta here.

00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
Yeah.

218
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,776
The kid found him.

Was there anyone else

00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,784
in the house when you arrived?

[melancholy song playing]

222
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,386
We really gotta go, man.

223
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,062
[Pete] Tonight,
a son lost a father.

224
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,064
A wife lost a husband.

225
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,485
And I lost a friend.

226
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,112
Mayor Mitchell was a fighter
for the city,

227
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,657
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

228
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,660
This was
a truly senseless crime,

229
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,037
and we are actively pursuing

230
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,122
every investigative lead
we have

231
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,875
in order to identify
the perpetrator

232
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,335
and hunt him down.

233
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,003
I've spoken to the governor...

234
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,631
[Bruce] I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

235
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,257
but I don't know.

[melancholy song continues]

237

Murder, robberies, assault.

Two years later,
they're all up.

239

And now this.

240
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,149
The city's eating itself.

241
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,111
Maybe it's beyond saving.

242
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,491
But I have to try.

243
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,660
Push myself.

Sometimes in the morning,

I have to force myself
to remember

00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,976
everything that happened.

Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

256
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,749
was found murdered last night
inside his home

257
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,626
in the exclusive
Crest Hill district.

258
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,669
[newscaster 2]
Exact details of the crime

259
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
still have not been released,

260
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,924
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

261
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,260
as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.

262
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,387
And this certainly
is not the first time

263
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,764
Gotham has been rocked

264
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,223
by the murder
of a political figure.

265
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,100
In fact,
in an eerie coincidence,

266
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,227
it was 20 years ago this week

267
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,896
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

268
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,940
Dr. Thomas Wayne
and his wife Martha

269
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,026
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

270
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,402
It was a shocking crime

271
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,821
that remains unsolved
to this day.

272
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,740
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s
political career

273
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,576
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

274
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,911
when he and city police

275
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,913
launched a major
sting operation

276
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,539
resulting in the arrest

277
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,959
of notorious mafia crime
figure Salvatore Maroni,

with what, to this day,

279
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,213
remains the biggest drug bust
in GCPD history.

280
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,589

I asked him to come, Pete.

291
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,052
Apparently.

292
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,138
You're becoming
quite a celebrity.

293
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,349
Why is he writing to you?

294
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,976
[Pete] It's Mitchell,
for chrissakes!

295
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,310
I don't know yet.

Here? Why?

301
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,740
Because I couldn't get you
to go there.

-I haven't got time for this.
-It's getting serious, Bruce.

If this continues,

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

305
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,164
I don't care about that.

Any of that.

You don't care
about your family's legacy?

What I'm doing
is my family's legacy.

if I can't have an effect,

then I don't care
what happens to me.

[Alfred smack lips]

326
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,946
"He lies still"
is only a partial key.

It only gives us
H, E, L, I, S, and T.

Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

who he pretended to be.

724
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,871
I mean, this Riddler,

725
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,539
he's going after the most
powerful people in the city.

726
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,874
He knows so much.

727
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,250
[Travis] He doesn't
know shit, man.

728
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,627
[Gil] What are you
talking about?

729
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,045
Yeah, he does!
What about that rat...

730
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,672
[Richie] Hey, hey,
Gil, come on.

731
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,340
-Hey. The rat.
-[Richie] Think maybe you had

732
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,549
-a little too much. Slow down.
-Ask him about the rat.

733
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,387
[Selina] Hey,
what's this about a rat?

734
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,350
[inhales deeply]

735
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,482
I mean,

736
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:49,611
there was a rat.
We had an informant.

737
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,114
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

738
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,949
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

739
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,575
He's talking about
the Maroni case.

740
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,496
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

741
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,914
And when it does,

742
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,040
this whole city's
gonna come apart.

743
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,917
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

744
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,419
This is
the kind of pillow talk

745
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
that got that Russian girl
disappeared.

746
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,381
What do you know about that?

747
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,967
-Does anybody want a drink?
-[Gil] I want a drink.

748
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,343
Keep him talking.

749
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,598
-Wait, where are you going?
-She knows Annika.

750
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,975
No, stay on the DA.

751
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,144
I told you
I'm looking for my friend.

752
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,105
Where's Annika?

753
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,523
Out of my face.
I don't know you.

754
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,816
Yeah, but you know her.
Who took her?

755
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,317
What have you heard?
Is she okay?

756
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,527
Jesus Christ,
keep your voice down.

757
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,903
What, you got a death wish?

758
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,822
[man] Hey,
what's the problem, ladies?

759
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,783
[Carla] There's no problem.
It's just girl talk.

760
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,452
Let's keep it festive
down here, all right?

761
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,745
[Carla] Sure thing, Oz.

762
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey.

763
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,128
Hey.

764
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:51,548
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

765
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,050
How you been?

766
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,096
Yeah, I've been okay.

767
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,807
I was just, um...

768
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,644
I was just headed back
upstairs.

769
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,438
Mm. Well,

770
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,191
don't be a stranger.

771
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,415
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

772
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,000
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

773
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,002
I don't have a relationship
with him, okay?

774
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,504
Well, that's not
what it looked like.

775
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,255
-Forget it.
-Wait, what are you doing?

776
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,507
[line breaking up] Listen,
I can't do this anymore.

777
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,674
No! No!

778
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,259
[static buzzes, stream stops]

779
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,305
[Selina] Taxi!

780
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,432
[heavy breathing]

781
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,310
[Gil] Hey!

782
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,063
I lost you in there.

783
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,272
Yeah, I gotta go.

784
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,108
Oh, you need a ride?

785
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,485
That's me right there.

786
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,029
[eerie music playing]

787
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,700
Taxi!

788
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,910
I'm good.

789
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,288
I hope, uh...

790
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,461
-I'll see you around.
-[car door closes]

791
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,467
[eerie music continues]

792
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,185
[car alarm chirps]

793
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,539
[glass squeaking]

794
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,666
[eerie music continues]

795
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,888
[breathes deeply]

796
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,930
[Gil grunts]

797
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,057
[train rumbles past]

798
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,104
[car horn blaring
continuously]

799
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,695
[car horn stops]

800
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,242
[Gil grunting weakly]

801
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,464
-[Gil grunts]
-[Riddler shushes]

802
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:41,343
[Riddler] Just hold still.

803
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,720
-[beeping]
-[Gil whimpers]

804
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,264
[Riddler breathing
heavily and raspily]

805
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,561
[eerie music continues]

806
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,778
[wistful music playing]

807
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,941
[switch clicks]

808
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,736
[Batman] What do you know
about a confidential informant

809
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,196
in the Maroni case?

810
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,785
Yeah, sure, there was.

811
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,538
That's the rat
we're looking for.

812
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,957
Somehow
Riddler knows who he is.

813
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,210
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

814
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,753
Where are you getting this?

815
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,715
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

816
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,634
Gil's very nervous.

817
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,429
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

818
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,305
I worked that case.

819
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,726
-Riddler's not after you.
-How do you know?

820
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,310
You're not corrupt.

821
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,896
Colson's dirty?

822
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,654
Maybe I, uh...

823
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,158
I go after him. Lean on him
to give up the rat.

824
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,534
It's too dangerous.

825
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,120
They made a secret deal
with this guy.

826
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,080
Who knows how many people
it touches.

827
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,501
Politicians. Police.
The courts.

828
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,587
It could tear
the whole city apart.

829
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,922
[Gordon] Jesus,
this is a powder keg.

830
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,885
[Batman]
And Riddler's the match.

831
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,428
[Batman on video]
You know Carmine Falcone.

832
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,305
[Selina] I told you
it's a mob spot.

833
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,973
[Batman] You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

834
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:52,932
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship...

835
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,684
[video rewinds]

836
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,436
[Batman] You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

837
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,604
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him.

838
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,897
-Okay?
-[video rewinds]

839
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,398
[Batman] You know
Carmine Falcone.

840
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,275
[Selina] I told you
it's a mob spot.

841
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,194
[Batman] You didn't tell me you
had a relationship with him.

842
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,612
{\an5}[Selina] I don't have
a relationship
with him. Okay?

843
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,654
-[Alfred] Pretty.
-[tape clicks off]

844
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,866
She a new friend of yours?

845
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,663
I'm not so sure.

846
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,291
Looks like you upset her.

847
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,668
Shall I take this
as a good sign?

848
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,629
-What?
-Your attire.

849
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,714
Is Bruce Wayne
making an actual appearance?

850
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,758
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

851
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,595
Serial killers like to follow
reactions to their crimes.

852
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,305
Riddler might not
be able to resist.

853
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,808
Oh, that reminds me.

854
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,602
I've taken the liberty
of doing a little work

855
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,437
on this latest cipher.

856
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,272
The one from the rat maze.

857
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,651
I'm afraid his Spanish
is not perfect,

858
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,694
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

859
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:50,573
"You are El Rata Alada."

860
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,242
[Bruce] Rata Alada?

861
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,368
"Rat with wings"?

862
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,577
It's slang for "pigeon."

863
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,162
Does that mean anything
to you?

864
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,372
Yeah.

865
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,166
A stool pigeon.

866
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,877
-Where are your cufflinks?
-I couldn't find them.

867
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,131
Well, you can't
go out like that.

868
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,174
Alfred, I don't want
your cufflinks.

869
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,180
You have to keep up
appearances.

870
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,599
-You're still a Wayne.
-[scoffs]

871
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,060
And what about you?
Are you a Wayne?

872
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,855
Your father gave them to me.

873
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,318

No more lies! No more lies!

880
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,133
Mr. Wayne. All right.

881
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,510
All right, you're going
straight down there.

You good, fellas?

889
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,082
Good.

890
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,294
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,933
[melancholy music continues]

892
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,104

[reporters continue clamoring]

[bodyguard] Hey!

895
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,794
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

896
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,797
Hey, watch it, fellas.

897
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,341
You got the prince
of the city there.

898
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,137
Some event, huh?

899
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,014
Brought out the one guy
in the city

900
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,307
more reclusive than me.

901
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,768
Thought you'd never leave
the Shoreline.

902
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,436
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

903
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,689
Why? 'Cause your father
ain't around?

904
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,441
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

905
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,151
Wow, is that right?

906
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,904
His father saved my life.

907
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,324
I got shot in the chest.
Right here.

908
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,743
I couldn't go to no hospital,

909
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,079
so we showed up
on his doorstep.

910
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,374
Operated right
on the dining room table.

911
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,669
Kid here,
he saw the whole thing,

912
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,879
up on the stairs looking down.

913
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,300
I remember your face.

914
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,387
You don't think that meant
something, he did that?

915
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,764
It meant he took
the Hippocratic oath.

916
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,684
"Hippocratic oath."

917
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,855
That's good.

918
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,148
Excuse me.

919
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,775
[laughs]

920
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,610
Yes.

924
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,209
[announcer on mic]
Ladies and gentlemen,

925
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,794
thank you all for coming
to today's memorial

926
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,713
for our beloved mayor,
Don Mitchell, Jr.

927
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,673
Our program
will begin shortly.

928
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,383
As a reminder,
the family asked

929
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,885
that those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

930
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,553
consider a donation
to the cause

931
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,430
-most dear to his heart...

...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

933
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,142
our city's safety net.

934
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,771
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

935
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,398
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it,

936
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,775
I can tell you that.

937
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,111
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

938
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,989
He got what he deserved.

939
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,867
Know what I mean?

940
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,245
Hey, don't I know you?

941
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,122
[woman] Bruce Wayne.

942
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,291
Why haven't
you called me back?

943
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,584
I'm sorry?

944
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,961
I'm Bella Real.
I'm running for mayor.

945
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,588
I wouldn't be bothering
you here,

946
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:18,007
but your people keep
telling me you're unavailable.

947
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,509
Will you walk with me?

948
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,513
[Ave Maria continues playing]

949
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,973
Mr. Wayne.

950
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,683
Mr. Wayne.

951
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,437
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

952
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,189
Your family
has a history of philanthropy,

953
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,858
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

954
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:39,028
If I'm elected,
I want to change that.

955
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,446
Thank you.

956
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,323
[Bella] My God.

957
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,536
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

958
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,246
I want to continue this.

959
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,418
Excuse me.

960
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,338
I'm so sorry for your loss.

961
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,716
Thank you.

962
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,301
[Gordon] Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

963
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,471
Gil Colson is missing.

964
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,722
[Mackenzie] What?

965
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,183
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

966
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,309
Christ, not again.

967
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,562
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

968
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,275
You got people
looking for him, Jim?

969
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,652
[Gordon] Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

970
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:20,987
[Mackenzie]
What'd his wife say?

971
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,155
[Gordon] She hadn't
heard from him.

[Gordon] Get out of the car!

Get out of the car
and show your hands!

984
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,674
Get out!

[officer] We don't know
if he's in on it.

1002
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:49,176
What's he looking at?

Gordon!

killed in there.

Please.

1013
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,351
He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

1014
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,644
He told me if I didn't do

1015
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,686
exactly what he said,
he'd kill me.

1016

I'm so sorry.

Can't we just cut it off?

to keep your head.

Me?

1025

I'm nobody.

1026
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,077
I'm just an instrument,

1027
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,870
here to unmask the truth

1028
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,540
about this cesspool
we call a city.

1029
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,125
"Unmask"?

1030
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,043
Yes.

1031
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,004
Let's do it together, okay?

1032
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,091
I've been trying to reach you.

1033
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,635
You're part of this, too.

1034
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,554
How am I a part of this?

1035
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,264
You'll see.

1036
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,099
[officer] Hey, Chief. You
better take a look at this.

1037

[Riddler on stream]
Say hello to my followers.

1038

{\an8}We're live.

1039

{\an8}They're here to watch
our little trial.

from you, Mr. Colson,

{\an8}is dead.

1043
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,656
Jesus, can we
get somebody out here?

1044
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,991
-This psycho's gonna kill me!
-But wait a minute...

1045
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,451
[shouting] Shut up!

1046
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,119
You deserve to be dead
after what you did!

1047
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,205
You hear me?

1048
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,915
[softly] Okay.

1049

[Riddler]
I'm giving you a chance.

1052
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:39,096
No one ever gave me a chance.

1053
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,975
Now,

1054
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:45,770
ever since I was a child,

1055
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,982
I've always loved
little puzzles.

1056
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:52,485
For me, they are a retreat

1057
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,946
from the horrors of our world.

1058
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,199
Maybe they can bring

1059
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,118
some comfort to you too,
Mr. Colson.

1060
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,537
-You want me to do puzzles?
-[chuckles excitedly]

Three riddles in two minutes.

You give me the answers,

1063
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,503
and I'll give you
the code for the lock.

01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,005
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

1065

The answer's "justice."

1075
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,027
-Justice?
-Yes!

1076
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,487
-Oh, God.
-Justice!

1077
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,198
[dramatically]
And you were supposed to be

1078
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,950
an arm of justice
in this city,

1079
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,536
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

1080
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,913
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1081
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,331
Of course, of course.

1082
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,542
- Of course.
-Riddle number two.

1083
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,754
"If you are justice,
please do not lie.

1084
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,050
"What is the price
for your blind eye?"

1085
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,052
-"The price"?
-[Batman] "Bribes."

1086
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:01,303
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

1087
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,513
He's asking you
how much it cost

1088
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:03,639
for you to turn your back.

1089
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,849
[hesitating]

1090
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,141
[shouting]
Fifty-eight seconds!

1091
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,685
-How much?
-Nothing!

1092
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,812
-[raises voice] How much?
-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1093
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,105
I get a monthly payment

1094
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,481
just not to prosecute
certain cases.

1095
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,899
-What cases?
-He didn't ask me that!

1096
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,609
-Come on! Ten grand.
-[Riddler laughing]

1097
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,152
That's my answer.
It's ten grand!

1098
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,612
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1099
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,282
Don't lose your head,
Mr. Colson.

1100
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:25,369
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

1101
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:27,746
[singsongy] Last riddle.

1102
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,084
[dramatically] "Since
your justice is so select,

1103
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,589
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

1104
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,799
-"Which vermin"?
-[Batman] The rat.

1105
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,050
The informant you all protect

1106
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,468
from
the Salvatore Maroni case.

1107
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,304
-How do you know about that?
-What's his name?

1108
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,097
-Twenty seconds.
-No.

1109
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,974
-He's gonna kill you.
-I'm a dead man either way.

1110
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:48,350
You're talking
to a dead man, okay?

1111
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,102
If I go out this way,
it's just me.

1112
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:53,272
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

1113
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,690
-He'll kill them, too.
-Who will?

1114
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,275
-People are watching.
-What people?

1115
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,319
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

1116
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,570
It's the whole system!

1117
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:01,530
{\an8}-Five! Four!
-[beeping rapidly]

1118
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,032
{\an8}-Oh, God, have mercy on me...
-Three!

1119
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,034
-Goodbye!
-[device trills]

1120
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,201
[Batman grunts]

1121
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,080
[people gasp]

1122
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,667

[ringing stops]

1126
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,024
[Martinez] Who do you
think he is under there?

1127
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,651
[Gordon] Take it easy.
[Martinez] I want to see.

1128
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,111
[medic] What is that thing?
Leather?

1129
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,325
[medic 2] What's he got
on his eyes?

1130
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,952
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1131
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,370
-We are we doing here?
-Let's just take it off...

1132
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,955
-[Gordon] Hey!
-[officers clamoring]

1133
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,123
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1134
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,166
Hey! Hey!

1135
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,834
Relax, God damn it!

1136
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,544
You're protecting
this guy, Jim?

1137
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,799
He interfered in an active
hostage situation.

1138
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,343
Colson's blood
is on his hands.

1139
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:05,803
Maybe it's on yours.

1140
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,180
What'd you say?

1141
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,391
He would rather die than talk.

1142
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:12,059
What was he afraid of?

1143
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,103
You?

1144
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,230
[menacing music playing]

1145
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,695
You son of a bitch.

1146
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,823
You have any idea what kind
of trouble you're in?

1147
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,533
You could be
an accessory to murder.

1148
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,742
[officer] Why are we
playing games...

1149
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,703
[officers clamoring]

1150
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:31,870
[officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1151
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,747
Back off! Back off!

1152
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,208
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1153
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,501
You got me
on assaulting three.

1154
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,086
Hey!

1155
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,380
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1156
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:43,924
[breathes heavily]

1157
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,384
You too now?

1158
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,053
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1159
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,638
You're gonna put yourself
on the line

1160
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,140
for this scumbag, Jim?

1161
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,225
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1162
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,479
Okay, give him the room.

1163
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,413
Two minutes.

1164
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,760
You listen to me.

1165
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,346
[softly]
We gotta get you out of here.

1166
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:34,808
[softly] That would put
a lot of heat on you.

1167
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,727
Well, you punched me
in the face.

1168
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:38,812
[Batman scoffs]

1169
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,230
Take this key.

1170
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,775
Through that door.

1171
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,652
Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1172
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:48,447
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1173
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,824
Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

1174
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,078
[suspenseful music playing]

1175
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,705
Who's the mustache
with the broken nose?

1176
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,628
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1177
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,463
He's one of the guys
I got into it with

1178
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,839
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1179
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,633
What are you saying?

1180
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,384
Kenzie moonlights
for the Penguin?

1181
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,056
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1182
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,978
-[officer] Jesus Christ!
-[Kenzie] Go!

1183
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,563
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1184
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,607

[groaning]

1192
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:49,651
[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1193
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,278
I did.

1194
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,071
Bock put out an APB on you.

1195
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,740
You really think
he's in on this?

1196
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,950
I don't trust any of 'em.
Do you?

1197
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,577
I only trust you.

1198
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,454
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1199
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,748
Colson said,
"Cops protect the rat."

1200
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,583
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1201
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,959
You think Penguin's the rat?

1202
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,461
His club caters to the mob.

1203
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,004
Maroni
practically lived there.

1204
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,048
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1205
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,382
DA was a regular, too.

1206
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,218
Maybe Penguin
got himself into a jam

1207
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,012
and working a deal
was his only way out.

1208
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,514
-The Rata Alada.
-The what?

1209
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,016
Riddler's latest.

1210
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,601
The cipher in the maze.

1211
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,354
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1212
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,565
A penguin's got wings, too.

1213
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,319
Time for me to have
another conversation with him.

1214
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,196
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1215
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,447
It's all connected.

1216
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,449
Like it or not,
it's his game now.

1217
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:40,744
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

1218
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:43,080
[thunder rumbling]

1219
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,331
[Gordon on radio]
Kenzie and the twins,

1220
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:45,582
coming your way.

1221
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,626
[Batman] There's Penguin.

1222
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,503
[Gordon] I wonder
what's in the bags.

1223
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,381
You want to move in?

1224
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,592
[Batman] Let's follow.

1225
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,844
[suspenseful music playing]

1226
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,352
[car horn honking]

1227
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,737
They stopped
at Waterfront Street.

1228
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,698
The recycling plant.

1229
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,200
[Batman] I'm here.

1230
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:22,119
-[Penguin] How you doing?
-[man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1231
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,328
[Penguin] Good, good.

1232
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,831
Let's get in
out of this deluge.

1233
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,000
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

1234
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,298
[suspenseful music continues]

1235
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,518
It's a drug lab. Drops.

1236
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:47,811
This is a buy.

1237
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:49,396
Looks like
they got Maroni's operation

1238
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,897
up and running again.

1239
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,065
Or they never
shut it down at all.

1240
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,692
[Gordon] What are you saying?

1241
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,945
The biggest drug bust
in GCPD history was a fraud?

1242
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,655
[motorcycle approaching]

1243
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,452
[suspenseful music continues]

1244
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,221

Wasn't enough,

You don't just work

you killed the girl?

I didn't kill no girl!

1356

But she got too close, right?

1357
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,554

1358
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:43,930
that you were the rat,
so you killed her.

1359

I ain't no rat!

1366
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,405
You got any idea what
Carmine Falcone would do to me

1367
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:01,656
if he heard this kind of talk?

1368
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,700
Oh, you don't wanna talk
about rats, huh?

1369
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:04,993
Maybe we can talk about

1370
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:06,327

to my partner's face.

1371
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,912

showing me here?

01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,747

01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,223
"You are El Rata"?
It says that?

1381
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:28,641
Why, you got something
to tell us?

1382
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:29,976
Yeah!

1383
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:31,603
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,938
-What?
-It's "La."

Thank you for coming today.

1443
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,197
I believe in Gotham.

1444
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,201
I believe in its promise.

1445
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,372
But too many have been
left behind for too long,

1446

my candidacy for mayor,

1448
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:10,047

of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

he stabilizes.

why a guy like Falcone
would owe you anything.

Because he's my father!

at the 44 Below.

1537
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,692
Just like Anni.

1538
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,405
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1539
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:52,825

Yeah.

while she worked.

Used to see him there.

1543
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,296
He scared the shit out of me.

1544
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:08,382
And I could never understand

1545
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:10,926
why he looked at me
the way he did.

1546
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,972
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1547
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,769
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

Strangled.

1549
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:24,523
Never found out who.

1550
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,817
Probably some creep
from the club.

1551
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:30,613
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1552
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:33,032
and he didn't say a thing.

1553
01:38:34,783 --> 01:38:36,660
Couldn't even look at me.

1554
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,166
He owes me that money.

1555
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,377
I'm sorry.

1556
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:47,671

so different after all.

1562

for Annika, no one will.

in this place

as I'm concerned,

1575
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,656
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1576
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,074
I think you'd be on his side.

01:40:18,762 --> 01:40:21,098
Just don't make any moves
without me, understand?

than you know...

{\an8}that giving back
is not just an obligation,

{\an8}But what is their real legacy?

1600
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,914
{\an8}Twenty years ago,
one reporter set out

1601
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,665
{\an8}to uncover the dark truth.

01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:33,045
{\an8}He found
shocking family secrets.

1603
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:35,088
{\an8}How, when Martha
was just a child,

1604

{\an8}her mother
brutally murdered her father,

1605

1607
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:44,723
{\an8}used their power and money
to cover it up.

1608
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,683
{\an8}How Martha herself

1609
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,520
{\an8}was in and out of institutions
for years,

1610
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,523

personal stuff
about your mother,

her family history.

1665
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,600
You know, everybody's got
their dirty laundry,

1666

that's just how it is.

1667
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,144
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1668

not right before the election.

1669

And your father
tried to pay the guy off,

1670
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:42,651
but he wasn't going for it.

1671
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:44,319
So...

1672
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:45,737
he came to me.

1673
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:48,365
Well, I never seen him
like that.

1674
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,535
He said, "Carmine,

1675

"I want you to put
the fear of God in this guy."

1676

Oof. Hmm.

1678
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:09,011
Your father wanted me
to handle it, so I did.

1679
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,847
I handled it.

1680
01:45:13,515 --> 01:45:14,808
I know.

1681
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,310
You thought your father
was a Boy Scout.

1682
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,272
But you'd be surprised

1683
01:45:20,355 --> 01:45:22,691
what even a good man like him

1684
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:25,527
is capable of
in the right situation.

Do me a favor.

01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,616
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1688
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:36,246
was a lowlife.

1689
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:37,873

-Maroni?
-Oh, yeah.

1691
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:45,756
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1692
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:48,091
And... And after what happened
with that reporter,

1693
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:49,843
Maroni was worried

1694
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,429
that your father
would be in my pocket

1695
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,639
forever.

1696
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:56,767
He would have done anything

1697
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,102
to keep him
from becoming mayor.

1698
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,562
You understand?

1699
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:03,023
Are you saying

1700
01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:06,276
Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1701
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:08,445
Do I know it for a fact?

1702
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:12,949
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1703
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:16,495
This is what you wanted, huh?

1704
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:19,331

my whole life.

1715
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:51,131
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1716
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,262
He told me what he did
for my father.

1717
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,893
About Salvatore Maroni.

1718
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:07,397
He told you
Salvatore Maroni...

1719
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,316
Had my father killed.

1720
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:13,987
Why didn't you tell me
all this?

1721
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:21,661
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1722
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:24,080
believing that he was
a good man.

1723
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,374
He was a good man.

1724
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,084
You listen to me.

1725
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,713
Your father was a good man.

1726

-He made a mistake.
-A "mistake."

1727
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,512
He had a man killed.

1728
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:41,681
Why?

1729
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:45,101
[sighing]
To protect his family image?

1730
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:47,270
His political aspirations?

1731
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,813
It wasn't to protect
the family image,

1732
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:51,066
and he didn't have
anyone killed.

1733
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:55,779
He was protecting your mother.

1734
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:59,616
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1735
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,910
He cared about her

1736
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:03,370
and you,

1737
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:06,039
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1738
01:49:06,122 --> 01:49:10,460
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1739
01:49:10,543 --> 01:49:12,170
Your father should have known

1740
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:13,880
that Falcone would do anything

1741
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:17,133
to finally have something
on him that he could use.

1742
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,052
That's who Falcone is.

1743
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,556
And that was
your father's mistake.

1744
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,642
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1745
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:29,145
your father was distraught.

1746
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:32,482
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1747
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:34,901
that he would confess
everything.

1748
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,321
And that night,

1749
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:41,157
your father and your mother

1750
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,409
were killed.

1751
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:46,579
[soft music playing]

1752
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,582
It was Falcone?

1753
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:55,505
[smacks lips]

1754
01:49:55,588 --> 01:49:57,757
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1755
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:05,932
Or maybe it was some
random thug on the street

1756
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:07,475
who needed money, got scared,

1757
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:08,852
and pulled the trigger
too fast.

1758
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:12,022
If you don't think
I've spent every day

1759
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,190
searching for that answer...

1760
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:20,280
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1761
01:50:20,363 --> 01:50:22,324
I know you always
blamed yourself.

1762
01:50:22,407 --> 01:50:24,909
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1763
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:29,331
I could see the fear
in your eyes,

1764
01:50:30,623 --> 01:50:33,043
but I didn't know how to help.

1765
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:36,796
I could teach you
how to fight, [sighs]

1766
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,716
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1767
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:41,676
You needed a father.

1768
01:50:43,553 --> 01:50:46,056
And all you had was me.

1769
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:49,642
I'm sorry.

1770
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:53,313
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1771
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:01,196
God.

1772
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:08,578
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1773
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:13,416
I thought
I'd mastered all that.

1774
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:21,132
I mean,

1775
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:24,469
I'm not afraid to die.

1776
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:28,598
I realize now
there's something

1777
01:51:29,682 --> 01:51:31,601
I haven't got past.

1778
01:51:32,477 --> 01:51:34,270
This fear...

1779
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:39,692
of ever going through
any of that again.

1780
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:46,116
Of losing somebody
I care about.

1781
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:06,845
[soft music continues]

1782
01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:16,688

[engine revving]

1784
01:52:36,749 --> 01:52:37,792
Hey.

1785
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:40,503
I saw the signal.
That's not you?

1786
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,464
I thought it was you.

1787
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:48,052
[both grunting]

1788
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:56,853
-I found him!
-I see that.

1789
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:58,438
He had my shit and my phone.

1790
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:00,064
She left a message
the night they took her.

1791
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:02,525
-She called me...
-Gordon! Help me out, man!

1792
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,152
She got my gun!

1793
01:53:04,235 --> 01:53:05,403
[grunts]

1794
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:08,281
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1795
01:53:08,364 --> 01:53:11,117
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1796
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:17,749
-[cellphone beeps]
-Here. Listen.

1797
01:53:19,709 --> 01:53:21,544
[Kenzie on recording]
Hey! Get back here!

1798
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:22,879
-[Annika whimpering]
-Where you going?

1799
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,464
Come back here!

1800
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:25,798
[Falcone] Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1801
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:27,217
You're scaring her.

1802
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,885
[Kenzie] I'm...
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1803
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,220
[Annika tearfully]
Please, please, please.

1804
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,721
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1805
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:34,474
[Falcone] Hey, don't be scared.
Come here.

1806
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:38,895
Now let me ask you again.

1807
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:41,564
-What did Mitchell tell you?
-[Annika] No, nothing. He...

1808
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:44,609
[Falcone] Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1809
01:53:44,692 --> 01:53:47,862
Especially to pretty girls
like you.

1810
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:50,573
That's why I made him
take your passport,

1811
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:53,493
until we could have
this little conversation.

1812
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:56,287
[Annika] All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1813
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:58,164
You'll never hear from me
again, nobody will.

1814
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,832
Please, please...

1815
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,585
[Falcone] We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1816
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:06,089
But first, I gotta know...

1817
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:08,216
-What did he tell you?
-[Annika] He...

1818
01:54:08,299 --> 01:54:12,345
He just said they all made
a deal with you.

1819
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:15,765
[Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
He told you about that, huh?

1820
01:54:15,848 --> 01:54:17,100
The deal.

1821
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:18,685
[Annika] He said

1822
01:54:18,768 --> 01:54:22,021
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1823
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:24,774
and that's how
he became mayor.

1824
01:54:24,857 --> 01:54:27,402
He said you were
a very important man.

1825
01:54:27,485 --> 01:54:28,653
[Falcone] Right.

1826
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:30,697
Mm-hmm.

1827
01:54:31,614 --> 01:54:33,908
Hmm. Okay.

1828
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:38,580
-[tussling on recording]
-[Annika screams]

1829
01:54:38,663 --> 01:54:41,249
-[Annika cries]
-[tussling continues]

1830
01:54:41,332 --> 01:54:42,792
-[Falcone] Just take it easy.
-[Annika choking]

1831
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,419
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1832
01:54:44,502 --> 01:54:47,630
[Falcone] Take it easy.

1833
01:54:49,382 --> 01:54:50,592
[recording stops]

1834
01:54:56,806 --> 01:54:58,141
Rata Alada.

1835
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:04,856
A falcon has wings, too.

1836
01:55:04,939 --> 01:55:06,858
Falcone is the rat?

1837
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:21,497
Falcone works for you guys?

1838
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:24,167
The mayor? The DA?

1839
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:28,796
No. [breathing shakily]

1840
01:55:31,299 --> 01:55:32,634
We work for him.

1841
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:34,886
Everybody does.

1842
01:55:34,969 --> 01:55:36,012
How?

1843
01:55:36,095 --> 01:55:38,264
Through Renewal.

1844
01:55:38,348 --> 01:55:39,641
Renewal is everything.

1845
01:55:39,724 --> 01:55:41,684
-The Renewal Fund?
-[Kenzie] Yeah.

1846
01:55:41,768 --> 01:55:42,935
After Thomas Wayne died,

1847
01:55:43,019 --> 01:55:45,355
they all went after it
like vultures.

1848
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:49,192
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1849
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,444
It was perfect
for making bribes,

1850
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:52,737
laundering money.

1851
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,656
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1852
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:56,532
Everybody got a piece.

1853
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:58,534
But Falcone wanted more.

1854
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:03,706
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1855
01:56:04,874 --> 01:56:07,377
He'd rat out
his drops operation,

1856
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:10,338
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1857
01:56:10,421 --> 01:56:12,799
then install them all
as his puppets.

1858
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:15,593
You think this goddamn
election matters?

1859
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:19,722
Falcone's the mayor.

1860
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:22,433
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1861
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:24,435
Come on, Vengeance.

1862
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:26,979
Let's go kill
that son of a bitch.

1863
01:56:27,063 --> 01:56:28,439
This creep too.
Let's finish this.

1864
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:29,649
-Oh, God!
-No!

1865
01:56:29,732 --> 01:56:31,109
[gun clatters]

1866
01:56:31,192 --> 01:56:32,819
We'll get him.

1867
01:56:32,902 --> 01:56:34,904
-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1868
01:56:34,987 --> 01:56:38,116
-He owns the city!
-Cross that line,

1869
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:40,201
you'll become just like him.

1870
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:41,744
Listen to me.

1871
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:43,830
Don't throw your life away.

1872
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:51,713
Don't worry, honey.

1873
01:56:54,716 --> 01:56:56,050
I got nine of 'em.

1874
01:56:56,134 --> 01:56:58,344
-[screams]
-[Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!

1875
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:01,889
[Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]

1876
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:11,858
[Gordon] She won't
get out of there alive.

1877
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:14,110
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1878
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:16,487
-I have to stop her.
-Don't you mean "we"?

1879
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,574
I gotta do this my way.

1880
01:57:19,657 --> 01:57:20,700
And then what?

1881
01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:23,619
We do what Riddler said.

1882
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:25,413
Bring the rat into the light.

1883
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:30,918

1885
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:03,242
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1886
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:05,328
He ain't seein' nobody
tonight.

1887
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:06,871
Tell him it's about Annika.

1888
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:12,084
Hey!

1889
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:13,628
Look who it is, huh?

1890
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:16,047
-Sorry to bother you.
-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1891
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:18,299
I was just hoping I could
talk to you for a minute?

1892
01:58:18,382 --> 01:58:19,884
Absolutely.

1893
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:22,595

I'm just so worried.

1899
01:58:51,958 --> 01:58:53,709
I... I don't know
where she is.

1900
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:58,714
And I know that
you're a very important man.

1901
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:01,676
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

[inhales shakily]

1903
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:07,431

-I'm sorry. [sniffling]
-It's okay.

1905

-I'm so sorry.
-I understand. Here.

No, that's okay,

-Mr. Falcone?
-Vinnie!

1908
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,072
-Didn't I tell you?
-I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1909
01:59:23,155 --> 01:59:25,366
I really think you're gonna
want to see this.

1910

[Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.

1911

they all made a deal with you.

[Falcone] Oh. Hmm.

1923
02:00:02,403 --> 02:00:04,155
He told you about that, huh?

1924
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:05,740
The deal.

1925
02:00:05,823 --> 02:00:07,283
[Annika] He said

1926
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:10,620
you gave some information
on some drops thing,

1927

he became mayor.

02:24:59,357 --> 02:25:02,276
I've parked seven vans

2297
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:04,821
all along the city seawall.

2298
02:25:05,947 --> 02:25:07,907
And on the big night,

2299
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:10,243
[whispers] they will go boom.

2300
02:25:14,455 --> 02:25:16,958
[dramatic music playing]

2301
02:25:20,461 --> 02:25:21,671
[explosion]

2302
02:25:24,215 --> 02:25:26,509
-[explosion]
-[inaudible] Boom!

2303
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:32,890
-[explosion]
-[inaudible] Boom!

2304
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:37,186
When the vans blow,

2305
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,981
the flooding
will happen so fast,

2306
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:43,151
evacuation
will not be an option.

2307
02:25:43,234 --> 02:25:46,154
Those who are not
washed away

2308
02:25:46,237 --> 02:25:48,656
will race through the streets
in terror.

2309
02:25:48,739 --> 02:25:50,616
-[panicked screams]
-Call Gordon.

2310
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:52,827
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2311
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,328
[crowd cheering]

2312
02:25:54,412 --> 02:25:56,539
[Riddler] As breaking news
hits higher ground

2313
02:25:56,622 --> 02:25:58,332
in Gotham Square Garden,

2314
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:01,043
celebrations
will turn to panic,

2315
02:26:01,127 --> 02:26:02,795
as the venue becomes

2316
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:06,007
the city's shelter
of last resort.

2317
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:07,383
[sirens wailing]

2318
02:26:07,467 --> 02:26:11,429
And that's where
all of you come in.

2319
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:20,938
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

2320
02:26:21,022 --> 02:26:23,357
The pigs will have me
in their custody,

2321
02:26:23,441 --> 02:26:25,359
but that's okay.

2322
02:26:25,443 --> 02:26:29,947
Because then
it will be your turn.

2323
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:34,285
You'll be there, waiting.

2324
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:36,454
[dramatic music playing]

2325
02:26:44,921 --> 02:26:47,798
It's time for the lies
to finally end.

2326
02:26:47,882 --> 02:26:52,386
[dramatically]
False promises of renewal?

2327
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:53,804
Change?

2328
02:26:53,888 --> 02:26:57,391
We'll give them real,
real change now.

2329
02:26:57,475 --> 02:27:00,853
We've spent our lives
in this wretched place,

2330
02:27:00,937 --> 02:27:02,980
[shouts] suffering!

2331
02:27:03,064 --> 02:27:05,399
Wondering, "Why us?"

2332
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:08,736
Now they will spend their
last moments wondering,

2333
02:27:08,819 --> 02:27:10,905
[screams] why them?

2334
02:27:10,988 --> 02:27:13,199
I can't get through!
The lines are down.

2335
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,494
[sirens wailing]

2336
02:27:18,704 --> 02:27:21,332
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

2337
02:27:21,415 --> 02:27:23,042
I'm just trying
to get out of town, man!

2338
02:27:23,125 --> 02:27:26,045
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

2339
02:27:26,128 --> 02:27:27,505
You're gonna have to go
inside the Garden

2340
02:27:27,588 --> 02:27:28,923
-with everyone else.
-[distant explosion]

2341
02:27:29,006 --> 02:27:30,466
[people screaming]

2342
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:35,346
[crowd clamoring]

2343
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:37,640
[sirens wailing]

2344
02:27:37,723 --> 02:27:39,559
-Lieutenant, who's in charge?
-I really don't know.

2345
02:27:39,642 --> 02:27:41,143
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

2346
02:27:41,227 --> 02:27:43,062
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

2347
02:27:43,145 --> 02:27:44,480
We got an active situation.

2348
02:27:44,564 --> 02:27:46,232
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

2349
02:27:46,315 --> 02:27:47,650
and get the mayor-elect out
of here, now. Where is she?

2350
02:27:47,733 --> 02:27:48,985
-I can take you there.
-Come!

2351
02:27:49,068 --> 02:27:50,570
[crowd chattering]

2352
02:27:56,033 --> 02:27:58,119
[tense music playing]

2353
02:28:24,854 --> 02:28:26,314
[man] If we don't close
the doors, we're gonna have...

2354
02:28:26,397 --> 02:28:27,648
-MCU.
-...huge problems.

2355
02:28:27,732 --> 02:28:29,150
The water's
already started to breach.

2356
02:28:29,233 --> 02:28:30,192
I thought this was a shelter
of last resort.

2357
02:28:30,276 --> 02:28:31,527
Yeah, for a hurricane,

2358
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:33,237
but not if the whole seawall
comes down.

2359
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:34,739
[Bella] I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

2360
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:36,449
All right.
I'll go calm down the crowd

2361
02:28:36,532 --> 02:28:38,159
-so we can get everyone in.
-It's not safe for you here.

2362
02:28:38,242 --> 02:28:39,660
We need to get you out,
Ms. Real.

2363
02:28:39,744 --> 02:28:41,704
-I'm not going anywhere.
-We're under attack, ma'am.

2364
02:28:41,787 --> 02:28:43,539
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

2365
02:28:43,623 --> 02:28:45,708
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing,

2366
02:28:45,791 --> 02:28:46,792
but I'm not.

2367
02:28:46,876 --> 02:28:48,461
-Excuse me.
-Ma'am...

2368
02:28:53,549 --> 02:28:54,842
Everyone, everyone,

2369
02:28:54,925 --> 02:28:56,886
if I could just
get your attention.

2370
02:28:56,969 --> 02:28:59,472
Please!
I just need your attention!

Martial law is in effect,

never sleeps.

2466

02:39:26,598 --> 02:39:28,350
in our institutions,

2475
02:39:28,433 --> 02:39:30,560
in our elected officials,

2476
02:39:30,644 --> 02:39:32,479
in each other.

2477
02:39:32,563 --> 02:39:35,691
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

2478
02:39:35,774 --> 02:39:36,817
[woman speaks indistinctly]

2479
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:38,610
[helicopter blades whirring]

2480
02:39:40,237 --> 02:39:42,114
[Bruce] I'm starting
to see now.

2481
02:39:43,448 --> 02:39:45,742
I have had an effect here...

2482
02:39:47,703 --> 02:39:49,746
but not the one I intended.

2483
02:39:51,957 --> 02:39:55,168
Vengeance
won't change the past,

2484
02:39:56,420 --> 02:39:58,880
mine or anyone else's.

2485
02:40:01,258 --> 02:40:03,343
I have to become more.

2486
02:40:06,346 --> 02:40:08,932
People need hope.

2487
02:40:09,016 --> 02:40:11,476
To know
someone's out there for them.

2488
02:40:15,147 --> 02:40:16,898
The city's angry,

2489
02:40:17,774 --> 02:40:19,192
scarred,

2490
02:40:20,068 --> 02:40:21,361
like me.

2491
02:40:23,363 --> 02:40:26,700
Our scars can destroy us.

2492
02:40:26,783 --> 02:40:29,661
Even after the physical wounds
have healed.

2493
02:40:31,204 --> 02:40:33,040
But if we survive them,

2494
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:36,418
they can transform us.

2495
02:40:38,170 --> 02:40:40,213
They can give us the power

2496
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:42,674
to endure...

2497
02:40:43,967 --> 02:40:46,178
and the strength to fight.

2498
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:50,891
[reporter] We are live.
As you can see,

2499
02:40:50,974 --> 02:40:53,977
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden,

2500
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:55,479
helping to save the lives

2501
02:40:55,562 --> 02:40:57,356
-of hundreds of victims.
-[Riddler moaning]

2502
02:40:57,439 --> 02:40:58,899
And now as first responders

2503
02:40:58,982 --> 02:41:00,484
desperately scramble
to help the injured,

2504
02:41:00,567 --> 02:41:02,944
a mysterious masked man
emerges,

2505
02:41:03,028 --> 02:41:05,489
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

2506
02:41:05,572 --> 02:41:08,158
[man] Isn't that just terrible?

2507
02:41:09,493 --> 02:41:11,244
Him...

2508
02:41:11,328 --> 02:41:15,707
raining on your parade
like that? [tutting]

2509
02:41:20,045 --> 02:41:22,130
What is it they say?

2510
02:41:23,215 --> 02:41:25,467
"One day you're on top...

2511
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:28,679
the next,

2512
02:41:30,013 --> 02:41:32,432
you're a clown."

2513
02:41:32,516 --> 02:41:34,226
[exhales ruefully]

2514
02:41:34,309 --> 02:41:35,477
Well...

2515
02:41:37,062 --> 02:41:40,065
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

2516
02:41:40,148 --> 02:41:42,234
[Riddler weeping]

2517
02:41:42,317 --> 02:41:45,070
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

2518
02:41:46,321 --> 02:41:48,198
You did so well.

2519
02:41:52,661 --> 02:41:53,703
And you know,

2520
02:41:55,247 --> 02:41:58,583
Gotham loves a comeback story.

2521
02:42:08,552 --> 02:42:10,303
[Riddler] Who are you?

2522
02:42:10,387 --> 02:42:12,973
[man] Well,
that's the question,

2523
02:42:14,182 --> 02:42:15,350
isn't it?

2524
02:42:18,437 --> 02:42:20,856
Riddle me this...

2525
02:42:23,066 --> 02:42:25,819
"The less of them you have,

2526
02:42:25,902 --> 02:42:29,823
the more one is worth."

2527
02:42:35,245 --> 02:42:36,997
A friend.

2528
02:42:39,458 --> 02:42:42,544
[laughing maniacally]

2529
02:42:45,797 --> 02:42:48,717
[both laughing maniacally]

2530
02:43:03,565 --> 02:43:04,983
-[Batman] You're leaving.
-[gasps]

2531
02:43:05,066 --> 02:43:06,193
[Selina] Jesus.

2532
02:43:07,986 --> 02:43:09,696
Don't you ever just say hello?

2533
02:43:12,157 --> 02:43:13,200
[cat meows]

2534
02:43:14,576 --> 02:43:16,036
Where will you go?

2535
02:43:17,454 --> 02:43:20,248
I don't know. Upstate.

2536
02:43:20,332 --> 02:43:22,083
Bludhaven, maybe.

2537
02:43:22,959 --> 02:43:23,960
Why?

2538
02:43:25,086 --> 02:43:26,379
You asking me to stay?

2539
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:35,680
You know this place
is never gonna change.

2540
02:43:35,764 --> 02:43:38,433
With Carmine gone, it's only
gonna get worse for you.

2541
02:43:38,517 --> 02:43:40,435
There's gonna be a power grab.

2542
02:43:41,853 --> 02:43:43,021
It'll be bloody.

2543
02:43:43,647 --> 02:43:44,856
I know.

2544
02:43:46,566 --> 02:43:47,817
But the city can change.

2545
02:43:47,901 --> 02:43:49,110
It won't.

2546
02:43:50,153 --> 02:43:51,488
I have to try.

2547
02:43:51,571 --> 02:43:53,031
It's gonna kill you
eventually. You know that.

2548
02:43:55,325 --> 02:43:56,451
Listen.

2549
02:43:58,828 --> 02:44:00,163
Why don't you come with me?

2550
02:44:01,039 --> 02:44:03,124
Get into some trouble.

2551
02:44:03,208 --> 02:44:05,085
Knock off some
CEO hedge fund types.

2552
02:44:05,168 --> 02:44:07,420
It'll be fun.

2553
02:44:07,504 --> 02:44:09,047
The bat and the cat.

2554
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:12,342
It's got a nice ring.

2555
02:44:23,937 --> 02:44:25,522
[scoffs]

2556
02:44:25,605 --> 02:44:27,023
Who am I kidding?

2557
02:44:28,441 --> 02:44:30,652
You're already spoken for.

2558
02:44:31,486 --> 02:44:33,530
[soft music playing]

2559
02:44:42,497 --> 02:44:43,873
You should go.

2560
02:44:52,299 --> 02:44:53,300
Selina...

2561
02:44:57,304 --> 02:44:59,055
Take care of yourself.

2562
02:45:10,567 --> 02:45:11,943
[engine starts]

2563
02:45:17,866 --> 02:45:20,118
[soft music continues]

-[engine roaring]
-[music building up]

[dramatic music playing]

2570
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:15,436
[soft music playing]

2571
02:50:24,797 --> 02:50:27,926
[classical piano music
playing]

2572
02:53:58,636 --> 02:54:01,806
[melancholy orchestral
music playing]
